The Probability Mass Function (PMF) of a Poisson distribution gives the probability of observing a specific number of events (`k`) in a fixed interval of time or space, 
given the mean rate (`lambda_`) of events occurring in that interval. Here's a detailed explanation of the calculation:

1. **Calculation in Python**:
   - In Python, you can use the `pmf` method of the `scipy.stats.poisson` module to calculate the PMF.
   - The syntax is `poisson.pmf(k, lambda_)`, where `k` is the number of events and `lambda_` is the mean rate.
   - For example, if `k = 3` and `lambda_ = 2.5`, you would calculate the PMF as follows:
     ```python
     pmf = poisson.pmf(3, 2.5)
     ```

2. **Interpretation**:
   - The output `pmf` represents the probability of observing exactly 3 events in a Poisson distribution with a mean rate of 2.5 events. 
   - This means that if the mean rate is 2.5 events per interval, the probability of exactly 3 events occurring in that interval is approximately 0.2138 (or 21.38%).

3. **Printing the Result**:
   - The `print` statement is used to display the calculated probability along with a descriptive message:
     ```python
     print(f"The probability of observing exactly 3 events is {pmf:.4f}")
     ```
   - The `.4f` formatting specifier is used to round the probability to four decimal places for better readability.

Overall, the PMF helps us understand the likelihood of observing a specific number of events in a Poisson distribution, given the mean rate of events.
