Uniform Distribution (Discrete):
This distribution models the situation where all outcomes are equally likely within a certain range. 
randint.pmf(k, low, high) 
calculates the probability of choosing the value `k` as the outcome, where `k` is in the range `(low, high)` (inclusive of `low`, exclusive of `high`).

Example:
In the code you provided:

from scipy.stats import randint
req_prob = randint.pmf(k=3, low=1, high=7) + randint.pmf(k=4, low=1, high=7)
req_prob


You are calculating the probability of choosing either 3 or 4 out of the set `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` using the `randint.pmf()` function. Here's the breakdown:

- `randint.pmf(k=3, low=1, high=7)` calculates the probability of choosing 3 from the range `[1, 7)` (inclusive of 1, exclusive of 7), which is 1/6 or approximately 0.1667.
- `randint.pmf(k=4, low=1, high=7)` calculates the probability of choosing 4 from the same range, which is also 1/6 or approximately 0.1667.

Adding these two probabilities together gives:

0.1667 + 0.1667 = 0.3333

So, the output `req_prob` is approximately 0.33, which represents the probability of choosing either 3 or 4 out of the set `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.
