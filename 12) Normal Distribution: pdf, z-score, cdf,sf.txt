Here's a brief explanation of each concept related to the Normal Distribution:

1. pdf (Probability Density Function):
   - The pdf gives the probability density at a specific point (x) in a normal distribution.
   - For a continuous distribution, the probability at a single point is technically zero, but the pdf gives the density of probability around that point.

2. Calculating z-score:
   - To use the normal distribution for calculations, we often standardize the values using the z-score formula: z = (x-mu)/sigma.
   - Here,  x is the value we're interested in, the mean is denoted by mu, and the standard deviation by sigma.
   - The z-score tells us how many standard deviations a value is from the mean.

3. cdf (Cumulative Distribution Function):
   - The cdf gives the probability that a random variable X will take a value less than or equal to x in a normal distribution.
   - It represents the area under the normal curve to the left of x.

4. sf (Survival Function):
   - The sf gives the probability that a random variable X will take a value greater than x in a normal distribution.
   - It's the complement of the cdf, i.e.,  1 - cdf.

In summary, the pdf gives the density of probability at a point, the cdf gives the probability up to that point, and the sf gives the probability beyond that point. 
These functions are used to calculate probabilities and make inferences about data in a normal distribution.
