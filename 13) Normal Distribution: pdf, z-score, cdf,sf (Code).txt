Let's consider an example where we have a normal distribution with 
a mean (average) of 100,
a standard deviation of 10. 
We want to calculate the probability of a value being less than 95 and the probability of a value being greater than 110.

1. Probability Density Function (pdf):
   - The pdf gives the probability density at a specific point. Since the probability at a single point in a continuous distribution is technically zero, 
   the pdf gives us the density of probability around that point.
   - For example, the pdf at x=100 would be calculated as follows:

     ```python
     import scipy.stats as stats

     mean = 100
     std_dev = 10
     x = 100
     pdf_value = stats.norm.pdf(x, loc=mean, scale=std_dev)
     print(pdf_value)
     ```
     Output: The output would be 0.04 value indicating the density of the probability at x=100.

2. Calculating z-score:
   - To calculate the z-score for a specific value, we use the formula: z = (x - mean)/std deviation.
   - For example, if we want to find the z-score for a value of 95:

     ```python
     x = 95
     z = (x - mean) / std_dev
     print(z)
     ```
     Output: -0.5 (indicating that 95 is 0.5 standard deviations below the mean).

3. Cumulative Distribution Function (cdf):
   - The cdf gives the probability that a random variable X will take a value less than or equal to x in a normal distribution.
   - For example, to find the probability of a value being less than 95:

     ```python
     cdf_value_less_than_95 = stats.norm.cdf(95, loc=mean, scale=std_dev)
     print(cdf_value_less_than_95)
     ```
     Output: 0.3085375387259869 (approximately 30.85%).

4. Survival Function (sf):
   - The sf gives the probability that a random variable X will take a value greater than x in a normal distribution.
   - For example, to find the probability of a value being greater than 110:

     ```python
     sf_value_greater_than_110 = stats.norm.sf(110, loc=mean, scale=std_dev)
     print(sf_value_greater_than_110)
     ```
     Output: 0.15865525393145707 (approximately 15.87%).

These calculations help us understand the distribution of values and make probabilistic statements about the data in a normal distribution.
