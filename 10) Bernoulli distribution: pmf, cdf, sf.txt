Certainly! Let's use the Bernoulli distribution to calculate the Probability Mass Function (PMF), Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), and Survival Function (SF) for a player with a 70% goal rate (p=0.7) scoring a goal (k=1) for a free kick.

```python
from scipy.stats import bernoulli

# Probability of scoring a goal
p = 0.7

# Outcome of interest (scoring a goal)
k = 1

# Probability Mass Function (PMF) - Probability of scoring a goal
goal_prob = bernoulli.pmf(k=1, p=p)
print(f"The probability of scoring a goal is {goal_prob:.4f}")

# Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) - Probability of scoring up to and including 1 goal
cdf = bernoulli.cdf(k=1, p=p)
print(f"The probability of scoring up to and including 1 goal is {cdf:.4f}")

# Survival Function (SF) - Probability of scoring more than 1 goal (complement of scoring 0 goals)
sf = bernoulli.sf(k=0, p=p)
print(f"The probability of scoring more than 1 goal is {sf:.4f}")
```

- The PMF calculates the probability of scoring a goal, which is 0.7000 (70%).
- The CDF calculates the probability of scoring up to and including 1 goal, which is 0.7000 (70%).
- The SF calculates the probability of scoring more than 1 goal, which is 0.3000 (30%).
