Poisson Distribution:

This distribution is used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
Example:
The number of phone calls received at a call center in a minute, the number of accidents at an intersection in a day, or the number of emails received per hour.

scipy.stats.poisson.pmf() calculates the probability mass function.
scipy.stats.poisson.cdf() calculates the cumulative distribution function.
scipy.stats.poisson.sf() calculates the survival function (1 - CDF).
