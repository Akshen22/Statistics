Poisson Distribution:

This distribution is used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
Example:
The number of phone calls received at a call center in a minute, the number of accidents at an intersection in a day, or the number of emails received per hour.

scipy.stats.poisson.pmf() calculates the probability mass function.
scipy.stats.poisson.cdf() calculates the cumulative distribution function.
scipy.stats.poisson.sf() calculates the survival function (1 - CDF).

Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Importing the `poisson` module from `scipy.stats`**:
   ```python
   from scipy.stats import poisson
   ```

2. **Defining the mean rate of events (`lambda_`) and the number of events (`k`)**:
   ```python
   lambda_ = 2.5  # Mean rate of events
   k = 3          # Number of events
   ```

3. **Calculating the Probability Mass Function (PMF)**:
   - The PMF gives the probability of observing exactly `k` events in a Poisson distribution with mean rate `lambda_`.
   ```python
   pmf = poisson.pmf(k, lambda_)
   print(f"The probability of observing exactly {k} events is {pmf:.4f}")
   ```
   - In this case, the output will be: "The probability of observing exactly 3 events is 0.2138"

4. **Calculating the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**:
   - The CDF gives the probability of observing up to `k` events in a Poisson distribution with mean rate `lambda_`.
   ```python
   cdf = poisson.cdf(k, lambda_)
   print(f"The probability of observing up to {k} events is {cdf:.4f}")
   ```
   - The output will be: "The probability of observing up to 3 events is 0.7576"

5. **Calculating the Survival Function (SF)**:
   - The SF gives the probability of observing more than `k` events in a Poisson distribution with mean rate `lambda_`.
   ```python
   sf = poisson.sf(k, lambda_)
   print(f"The probability of observing more than {k} events is {sf:.4f}")
   ```
   - The output will be: "The probability of observing more than 3 events is 0.2424"

These calculations help understand the probabilities associated with the Poisson distribution for a given mean rate and number of events.
