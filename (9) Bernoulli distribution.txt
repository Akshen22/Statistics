The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models a random experiment with two possible outcomes: success (usually denoted as 1) and failure (usually denoted as 0). 
It is named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli. 

The Bernoulli distribution is commonly used to model situations with binary outcomes, such as coin flips (heads or tails), the success or failure of a single experiment, or the presence or absence of a characteristic.

In Python, you can use the `scipy.stats.bernoulli` module to work with the Bernoulli distribution. The module provides functions to calculate the PMF, cumulative distribution function (CDF), survival function (SF), and other properties of the distribution.
