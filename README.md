# Statistics

Welcome to the Statistics repository! Here, you'll find files that cover various statistical topics. The repository is organized into different categories to help you navigate through the content:

## Probability Distributions Discrete Distributions (Files 1 to 10)
- These files explain probability distributions where outcomes are distinct, like the Binomial and Poisson distributions.

## Probability Distributions Continuous Distributions (Files 11 to 16)
- These files cover probability distributions where outcomes can take any value within a range, such as the Normal and Exponential distributions.

## Sampling (Files 16 to 20)
- Learn about different sampling techniques used to collect data, including random sampling and stratified sampling.

## Confidence Interval (Files 16 to 20)
- Understand how to calculate and interpret confidence intervals, which help estimate population parameters.

## Normality and Variance
- Normality (Shapiro-Wilk Test): These files discuss a test called Shapiro-Wilk to check if data follows a normal distribution.
- Variance (Levene's Test): These files cover Levene's test, which is used to compare variances between groups.

## Hypothesis Testing
- Explore the concept of hypothesis testing, including types of errors and significance levels.

## One Sample and Two Sample Test
- Learn about tests like the t-test and z-test, used to compare sample means or proportions.

## Chi-Square Test 
- Discover the chi-square test, which is used to analyze categorical data and test for independence between variables.

## ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
- Understand how ANOVA is used to compare means across multiple groups and assess differences in variance.

Feel free to explore each category to deepen your understanding of these statistical concepts and techniques.
