In a continuous uniform distribution, all intervals of the same length within the range are equally probable. Here's a brief explanation of the functions you mentioned:

1. pmf (Probability Mass Function):
   - The pmf gives the probability of observing a value at a specific point in a uniform distribution. 
   However, for a continuous uniform distribution, the pmf is constant over the range and 0 outside the range. 
   Therefore, it's more commonly used for discrete distributions.

2. cdf (Cumulative Distribution Function):
   - The cdf gives the probability that a random variable X will take a value less than or equal to x in a continuous uniform distribution.
   - For example, to find the probability of a value being less than or equal to 150 in a uniform distribution from 0 to 200:

     ```python
     import scipy.stats as stats

     cdf_value_less_than_150 = stats.uniform.cdf(150, loc=0, scale=200)
     print(cdf_value_less_than_150)
     ```
     Output: 0.75 (or 75%).

3. sf (Survival Function):
   - The sf gives the probability that a random variable X will take a value greater than x in a continuous uniform distribution.
   - For example, to find the probability of a value being greater than 50 in a uniform distribution from 0 to 200:

     ```python
     sf_value_greater_than_50 = stats.uniform.sf(50, loc=0, scale=200)
     print(sf_value_greater_than_50)
     ```
     Output: 0.75 (or 75%).

4. Probability of a Range:
   - To find the probability of a range of values in a continuous uniform distribution, you can subtract the cumulative probabilities at the two endpoints of the range.
   - For example, to find the probability of a value between 50 and 150 in a uniform distribution from 0 to 200:

     ```python
     prob_50_to_150 = stats.uniform.cdf(150, loc=0, scale=200) - stats.uniform.cdf(50, loc=0, scale=200)
     print(prob_50_to_150)
     ```
     Output: 0.5 (or 50%).

These functions help us understand the likelihood of different values occurring in a continuous uniform distribution and are useful for making probabilistic statements about the data.
