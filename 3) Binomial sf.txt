You would use the survival function (SF) when you want to find the probability that a random variable is greater than a certain value. In the context of the binomial distribution and the example you provided, you would use the SF if you wanted to find the probability of winning more than a certain number of rolls.

For example, if you wanted to find the probability of winning more than 10 rolls (i.e., winning 11 or more rolls out of 18), you would use the SF:

```python
from scipy.stats import binom

n = 18  # Total number of rolls
p = 4/6  # Probability of winning each roll

# Calculate the probability of winning more than 10 rolls
prob_more_than_10 = binom.sf(k=10, n=n, p=p)

print(f"The probability of winning more than 10 rolls is approximately {prob_more_than_10:.4f}")
```

In this case, the SF is used to find the probability of winning more than 10 rolls, which is the complement of the CDF that calculates the probability of winning up to 10 rolls.
