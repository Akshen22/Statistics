1.  Calculating the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**:
   - The CDF gives the probability of observing up to `k` events in a Poisson distribution with mean rate `lambda_`. 
   k = 3,
   lambda_ = 2.5
   ```python
   cdf = poisson.cdf(k, lambda_)
   print(f"The probability of observing up to {k} events is {cdf:.4f}")
   ```
   - The output will be: "The probability of observing up to 3 events is 0.7576"

2. **Calculating the Survival Function (SF)**:
   - The SF gives the probability of observing more than `k` events in a Poisson distribution with mean rate `lambda_`.
   k = 3,
   lambda_ = 2.5
   ```python
   sf = poisson.sf(k, lambda_)
   print(f"The probability of observing more than {k} events is {sf:.4f}")
   ```
   - The output will be: "The probability of observing more than 3 events is 0.2424"

These calculations help understand the probabilities associated with the Poisson distribution for a given mean rate and number of events.
